   **Description of our app**:
       
   Seeing how the pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live and the added emotional and mental baggage that comes with it, we wanted to create an app that could educate     and spread the message about the importance of mental health. But, from what we've seen, most mental health apps come off as not too engaging, therefore, we thought: "Why       not make the journey of cultivating and caring for your mental health more of an experience?". 

   Therefore, Cafe Depresso was created.
       
   **Features**:
