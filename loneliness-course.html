            Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to each individual. 
            <br>Because it has no single common cause, the prevention and treatment of this potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 3vw;padding-top: 5vw;">Definition of Loneliness &#9748;</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 2vw;text-align: justify;padding: 5vw;">
            While common definitions of loneliness describe it as a state of solitude or being alone, loneliness is actually a state of mind. 
            <br>Loneliness causes people to feel <strong><em> alone and unwanted</em></strong>.
            <br>People who are lonely often crave human contact, but their state of mind makes it more difficult to form connections with other people.
            <br>Researchers suggest that loneliness is associated with social isolation, poor social skills, introversion, and depression.
            <br>Loneliness, according to many experts, is not necessarily about being alone. Instead, if you feel alone and isolated, then that is how loneliness plays into your state of mind.
            <br>For example, a college freshman might feel lonely despite being surrounded by roommates and other peers. A soldier beginning their military career might feel lonely after being deployed to a foreign country, despite being constantly surrounded by other troop members.

      <p style="font-size: 2vw;text-align: justify;padding: 5vw;">
        While research clearly shows that loneliness and isolation are bad for both mental and physical health, being alone is not the same as being lonely. In fact, solitude actually has a number of important mental health benefits, including allowing people to better focus and recharge.
        <br><strong><em>Loneliness</em></strong>, is marked by feelings of isolation despite wanting social connections. It is often perceived as an involuntary separation, rejection, or abandonment by other people.
        <br><strong><em>Solitude</em></strong>, on the other hand, is voluntary. People who enjoy spending time by themselves continue to maintain positive social relationships that they can return to when they crave connection. They still spend time with others, but these interactions are balanced with periods of time alone.

      <p style="font-size: 2vw;text-align: justify;padding: 5vw;">
        Contributing factors to loneliness include situational variables, such as physical isolation, moving to a new location, and divorce. The death of someone significant in a person's life can also lead to feelings of loneliness.
        <br>Additionally, it can be a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression. Depression often causes people to withdrawal socially, which can lead to isolation. 
        <br>Research also suggests that loneliness can be a factor that contributes to symptoms of depression.
        <br>Loneliness can also be attributed to internal factors such as low self-esteem. People who lack confidence in themselves often believe that they are unworthy of the attention or regard of other people, which can lead to isolation and chronic loneliness.
        <br>Personality factors may also play a role.
        <br><em>Introverts</em>, for example, might be less likely to cultivate and seek social connections, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

      <p style="font-size: 2vw;text-align: justify;padding: 3vw;">
        Loneliness can be overcome. It does require a conscious effort to make a change. In the long run, making a change can make you happier, healthier, and enable you to impact others around you in a positive way.
        <br>Here are some ways to prevent loneliness: 
      </p>
      <ul style="font-size: 2vw;text-align: justify;padding:0 5vw 5vw 5vw;">
        <li><strong>Consider community service or another activity that you enjoy. </strong>

        <li><strong>Expect the best. </strong> 
            <br>Lonely people often expect rejection, so instead, try focusing on positive thoughts and attitudes in your social relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on developing quality relationships.</strong> 
            <br>Seek people who share similar attitudes, interests, and values with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize that loneliness is a sign that something needs to change. </strong>
            <br>Don't expect things to change overnight, but you can start taking steps that will help relieve your feelings of loneliness and build connections that support your well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand the effects of loneliness on your life.</strong> 
            <br>There are physical and mental repercussions to loneliness. If you recognize some of these symptoms affecting how you feel, make a conscious effort to combat them.</li>
